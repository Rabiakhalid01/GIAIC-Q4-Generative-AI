What is Pydantic?
Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library that uses Python type annotations to define and validate data schemas. It’s a core dependency of FastAPI, used for request/response validation, serialization, and deserialization. Pydantic ensures type safety and provides automatic error handling, making it ideal for DACA’s agentic workflows where data integrity is critical.

Key Features of Pydantic
Type-Safe Validation: Validates data against Python type hints (e.g., str, int, List[str]).
Automatic Conversion: Converts data to the correct type (e.g., string "123" to int 123).
Error Handling: Raises detailed validation errors for invalid data.
Nested Models: Supports complex, nested data structures.
Serialization: Converts models to JSON (or other formats) for API responses.
Default Values and Optional Fields: Simplifies schema definitions.
Custom Validators: Allows custom validation logic.


Why Pydantic for DACA?
Pydantic is critical for DACA because:

Data Integrity: Ensures incoming user data and agent responses are valid and type-safe.
Complex Workflows: Supports nested models for agentic AI scenarios (e.g., user messages with metadata, agent responses with context).
Serialization: Seamlessly converts models to JSON for API responses.
Error Handling: Provides clear validation errors, improving debugging in distributed systems.
